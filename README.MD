# Customer Churn Prediction for Travel and Tours Agency

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** The travel and tours agency faces the challenge of customer churn, impacting business sustainability and revenue. Identifying customers likely to churn is crucial for implementing proactive retention strategies.

## Solution

**Prediction Model:** Leveraging Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, we developed a predictive model to anticipate customer churn. This model empowers the agency to take preemptive measures to retain customers at risk of attrition.

## Technology Used

1. **Python:** The core programming language for flexibility and extensive data science libraries.
2. **Pandas:** Efficient data manipulation for preparing datasets.
3. **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization for insightful analysis.
4. **Scikit-Learn:** Building and training the predictive model.

## Visual Overview of Data

In the notebook, you'll find visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the data. Explore charts and graphs that provide a comprehensive overview of customer behavior and potential churn factors.

## Model Performance

- **Precision (0.5):** The model accurately predicts 50% of customers at risk of churn, minimizing false positives.
  
- **Recall (0.8):** Effectively identifies 80% of actual churn instances, reducing the likelihood of overlooking potential churn.
  
- **F1 Score (0.6):** Achieves a balanced trade-off between precision and recall, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the model's predictive capabilities.

## How to Open the Notebook

To explore how the model works, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** If not already installed, run `pip install notebook` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Download the Notebook:** Obtain the predictive model notebook from the designated repository or source.

3. **Navigate to the Notebook's Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt, use `cd` to navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:** Type `jupyter notebook` in the terminal and press Enter. This will open a new tab in your web browser.

5. **Access the Notebook:** In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the directory where the notebook is located and click on the notebook file (with a `.ipynb` extension).

6. **Run the Notebook Cells:** Once the notebook is open, run each cell sequentially to observe the model's functionality and visualize the results.

This hands-on approach allows you to interact with the model, understand its inner workings, and explore the insights it provides regarding customer churn for the travel and tours agency.
